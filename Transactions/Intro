Transaction - sequence of SQL operations executed as a single unit of work, follows ACID

A - Atomicity - All parts of the work unit have to be completed successfully, if any fail - none of them will succeed and the entire transaction will be rolled back
C - Consistency - Transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, ensuring that all defined rules are maintained
I - Isolation - Transactions are executed in isolation from one another, preventing transactions from interfering with one another
D - Durability - Once transaction is committed and completed, the effects and changes will be permanent, even in case of a system failure

Main commands in transaction:

BEGIN - Starts transaction block
COMMIT - commits the current transaction block, making all changes permanent
ROLLBACK - cancels all changes made by current transaction
SAVEPOINT - creates a point in transaction, to which you can rollback

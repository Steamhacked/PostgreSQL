Schema - is a container that groups database objects: tables, views, indexes, functions, etc. 

Schemas can only be access by the users they are assigned to

CREATE SCHEMA schema_name
CREATE SCHEMA [IF NOT EXISTS] AUTHORIZATION user_name; - for specific user_name owner

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO user_name - enables to access objects in schema

GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO user_name - enables to create objects in schema

ALTER SCHEMA schema_name RENAME TO new_schema_name
ALTER SCHEMA schema_name OWNER TO new_owner

DROP SCHEMA schema_name CASCADE - to drop all objects within schema
DROP SCHEMA schema_name RESTRICT - to ensure schema is dropped only when empty

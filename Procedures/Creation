CREATE PROCEDURE - creates stored procedure, which are beneficial for encapsulation business logic, especially when transaction execution is required.

Unlike user-defined functions, procedures are capable of transaction execution

CREATE [or REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name(parameter_list)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
  -- variable declaration
BEGIN 
  --stored procedure body
END; $$

CALL stored_procedure_name(argument_list)

While stored procedure does not return anything, a return with no value can be used to stop the procedure

return;

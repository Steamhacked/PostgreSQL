SEQUENCE - object (sequential values)

CREATE SEQUENCE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sequence_name
    [ AS { SMALLINT | INT | BIGINT } ]
    [ INCREMENT [ BY ] increment ]
    [ MINVALUE minvalue | NO MINVALUE ] 
    [ MAXVALUE maxvalue | NO MAXVALUE ]
    [ START [ WITH ] start ] 
    [ CACHE cache ] 
    [ [ NO ] CYCLE ]
    [ OWNED BY { table_name.column_name | NONE } ]

CYCLE - allows sequence to restart when limit is reached


CREATE SEQUENCE three
INCREMENT -1
MINVALUE 1 
MAXVALUE 3
START 3
CYCLE;

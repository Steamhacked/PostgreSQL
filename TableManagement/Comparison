Tables can be compared using EXCEPT, UNION and OUTER JOIN

EXCEPT - returns rows of the first table, that are not in the second table

SELECT cols FROM table_1 EXCEPT SELECT cols FROM table_2

UNION - returns rows of both tables combined, removing any repetitions

SELECT cols FROM table_1 UNION SELECT cols FROM table_2

FULL OUTER JOIN - returns rows that match given condition in both tables

SELECT cols FROM table_1 FULL OUTER JOIN bar USING (cols) WHERE condition

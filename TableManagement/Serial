SEQUENCE - object that generates a sequence of unique integers
SERIAL - pseudotype used to generate autoincrementing primary keys

SMALLSERIAL: Uses 2 bytes and stores values from 1 to 32,767.
SERIAL: Uses 4 bytes and stores values from 1 to 2,147,483,647.
BIGSERIAL: Uses 8 bytes and stores values from 1 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

CREATE TABLE table( id SERIAL );

When declaring SERIAL:
1) SEQUENCE is created with next value generated by sequence to be default for the column
2) Id is constrained to be NOT NULL, as SEQUENCE generates integers, which are non-null
3) Ownership of the sequence is assigned to the id column, hence if the id column or the table are dropped - sequence is deleted

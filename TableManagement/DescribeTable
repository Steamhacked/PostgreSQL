There are several ways to describe Table in PostgreSQL, in order to view table's column's details

psql:

psql is PostgreSQL's terminal/shell, that allows for Table description

Commands:

\d - lists details of a table/column
\d+ - lists extensive details of a table/column
\c - to connect to a different database, or to reconnect

information_schema:

information_schema.columns - is a catalog containing information of all the columns of all the tables

SELECT table_name, col_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'table_name'

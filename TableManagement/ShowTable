There are several ways of displaying list of all tables within a database

psql:

\dt - displays list of all tables within the current database

pg_catalog schema:

pg_catalog.pg_tables - is a catalogue containing information of all the tables (includes all tables, but system tables), allows for more complex filtering

SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE schemaname != 'pg_catalog' AND schemaname != 'information_schema';

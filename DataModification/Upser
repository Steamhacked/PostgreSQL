UPSERT - is a combination of UPDATE and INSERT, which inserts a new row into table, or updates an existing one. Achieved by slightly different syntax

INSERT INTO table(cols) VALUES(vals) ON CONFLICT target action;

target action for updating: 

DO UPDATE SET col1 = EXCLUDED.col1, col2 = EXCLUDED.col2;

DO NOTHING
